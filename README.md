# FEED READER 'TEST SUITES' PROJECT

## 1. About
In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. My task was to create test suites for the feedreader using Jasmine.

You can find the tests in: './jasmine/spec/feedreader.js'

Writing these test suites required analyzing multiple aspects of the application including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
