# Feed Reader Jasmine Test Suite TDD
By Jeremy Levett

## About
In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The task was to create test suites for the feedreader using [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/).
The tests are located in: './jasmine/spec/feedreader.js'.
Writing these test suites required analyzing multiple aspects of the application including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
